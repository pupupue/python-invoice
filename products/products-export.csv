\n
\nThe purpose of “Holy neon Trinity” was to create a series of three vases in Pop art style, which work both as a functional ceramic vase and as an interior lighting design object. Neon LED strips are built into the vases and three popular pop art icons are displayed - Rolling Stones tongue and lips logo, melting smiley face and prayer hands. These icons can be symbolized by three states: good – neutral - evil; beginning – middle - end; birth – life - death; mind – body - spirit; past – present - future; father – son - Holy spirit; etc.
\n
\nI’ve always been interested in ceramics together with lighting design and wanted to make something completely new in this category. The ceramic lighting options I could find online usually contain one point of light- either a light bulb or a candle. That made me wonder why no one in the ceramics field is working with led strips since they are more durable, reasonably priced and can be shaped to create interesting compositions. The more I learned about led strips the more I wanted to work with them to combine the two mediums. Since these neon led strips are waterproof I thought it would be fun to make a functional vase and light that can be used as both. For that to work of course I had to hide the wiring of the lights on the inside of the vase with special tunnel systems so there is no open wire that can be exposed to water. Definitely came out to be much more work then expected but since it was my diploma work I thought with the- go big or go home mentality.",,,taxable,,1,1,,0,0,,,,,0,,,1500,"All, Vases",,"World Wide","https://laurinsceramics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image00074.png, https://laurinsceramics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image00004-scaled.jpeg, https://laurinsceramics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image00003-scaled.jpeg, https://laurinsceramics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image00002-scaled.jpeg, https://laurinsceramics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image00001-scaled.jpeg, https://laurinsceramics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image00006-scaled.jpeg, https://laurinsceramics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image00005-scaled.jpeg, https://laurinsceramics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image00073-scaled.jpeg, https://laurinsceramics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image00080-scaled.jpeg",,,,,,,,,0

\nDimensions - 39 x 12 x 47 cm
\n

\n
\nThe vase will come with the correct power adapter to turn the light on and with controllable dimmers for the lights.
\n
\nDisclaimer - This it the first time I worked with lighting and can't promise how long the lights will work. If you want to purchase the Vase make sure you like it without the light effect as well.

\nThe purpose of “Holy neon Trinity” was to create a series of three vases in Pop art style, which work both as a functional ceramic vase and as an interior lighting design object. Neon LED strips are built into the vases and three popular pop art icons are displayed - Rolling Stones tongue and lips logo, melting smiley face and prayer hands. These icons can be symbolized by three states: good – neutral - evil; beginning – middle - end; birth – life - death; mind – body - spirit; past – present - future; father – son - Holy spirit; etc.

\nI’ve always been interested in ceramics together with lighting design and wanted to make something completely new in this category. The ceramic lighting options I could find online usually contain one point of light- either a light bulb or a candle. That made me wonder why no one in the ceramics field is working with led strips since they are more durable, reasonably priced and can be shaped to create interesting compositions. The more I learned about led strips the more I wanted to work with them to combine the two mediums. Since these neon led strips are waterproof I thought it would be fun to make a functional vase and light that can be used as both. For that to work of course I had to hide the wiring of the lights on the inside of the vase with special tunnel systems so there is no open wire that can be exposed to water. Definitely came out to be much more work then expected but since it was my diploma work I thought with the- go big or go home mentality.",,,taxable,,1,1,,0,0,,,,,0,,,1500,"All, Vases",,"World Wide","https://laurinsceramics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image00078-scaled.jpeg, https://laurinsceramics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image00012-scaled.jpeg, https://laurinsceramics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image00011-scaled.jpeg, https://laurinsceramics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image00008-scaled.jpeg, https://laurinsceramics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image00009-scaled.jpeg, https://laurinsceramics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image00010-scaled.jpeg, https://laurinsceramics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image00007-scaled.jpeg, https://laurinsceramics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image00076-scaled.jpeg, https://laurinsceramics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image00079-scaled.jpeg",,,,,,,,,0
